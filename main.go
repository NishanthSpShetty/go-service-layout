	//break them into packages as per the domain or some collective grouping of the resposnibility
	//
	//provide good name for package, functions for future you and others.
	//
	//avoid writing code in generic package such as util, common unless its necessory.
	//
	//if you dont find the right package name to put your function, write it in same pacakge where it is used, its okay to duplicate sometime.

	//good  package names help in discoverability
